# Gear wings
Make a pair of steampunk gear wings that really rotate.

# Materials:
-Stepper motor (28BYJ-48)
-Stepper driver (ULN2003 Driver)
-Adafruit Trinket 5V
-9V battery with header snap and wire leads
-6x jewelry header pins
-Cardboard
-4x M2x8 screws and M2 nuts for securing lid of electronics housing
-2x M3x8 screws and nuts for securing stepper motor 
-Strong glue such as Gorilla glue for assembling electronics backpack
-Straps/ribbons for wearing electronics backpack
-Optional on-off switch

# Arduino IDE notes
For borad, select Adafruit Trinket (ATtiny85 @16MHz). To upload, hold and release the button on the Trinket to enter bootloader mode, then upload using programmer (Ctrl+Shift+U) or Sketch > Upload Using Programmer.

# Recommended improvements:
-Add washers between the cardboard and the gears to reduce friction.
-Enlarge or reshape the profile of the electronics housing backpack to better distribute weight across the back. The pack tents to tilt forward, leading to misalignment of the gears.
